# resume-ranking

📌 Overview
The Resume Ranking System is an AI-powered tool designed to rank resumes based on relevance to a given job description. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, this system analyzes resumes and compares them with job requirements to generate a ranked list of candidates.

🚀 Features
✅ Extracts text from resumes (PDF/DOCX)
✅ Parses job descriptions for key skills and requirements
✅ Computes similarity scores using NLP techniques
✅ Ranks resumes based on job relevance
✅ User-friendly interface for efficient resume analysis

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
Natural Language Processing (NLP) (e.g., spaCy, NLTK)
Machine Learning (e.g., TF-IDF, BERT, or Word2Vec)
Streamlit (for UI)
PDF/DOCX Parsing (e.g., PyMuPDF, docx)
